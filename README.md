Started this project in 2019 as fun to explore Android Development and build using some templates already available.\n
Now after years all the codes are made public (open source). [2022]\n
The whole UI is fully designed by me with lots of modifications to the codes with adding lots of new feature.\n


If you are using my work, then a little mention will be great! [Originally Created by Aniket Biswas]\n
Have Fun!
