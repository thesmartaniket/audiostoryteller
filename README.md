Started this project in 2019 as fun to explore Android Development and build using some templates already available.<br />
Now after years all the codes are made public (open source) [2022].<br />
The whole UI is fully designed by me with lots of modifications to the codes with adding lots of new feature.<br />

**As of now all the services for uploading and streaming stories are shut-downed.**

You can change the webpage it loads and modify its functions to fulfill your work scenario. <br />

If you are using my work, then a little mention will be great! [Originally Created by Aniket Biswas].<br />
Have Fun!<br />
